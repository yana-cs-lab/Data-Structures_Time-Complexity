# Data-Structures_Time-Complexity
Comparison of search algorithms through time complexity analysis. This project implements and tests Linear Search (O(n)), Binary Search (O(log m)), and Exponential Search (O(log n)) on randomly generated arrays. It measures the average number of comparisons to highlight practical performance differences between theoretical complexities.
