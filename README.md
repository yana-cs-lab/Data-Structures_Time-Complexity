# Data Structures – Time Complexity Analysis 📊

This project demonstrates the performance differences between three search algorithms by measuring the **average number of comparisons** required.

## Algorithms Compared 🔍
- **Search1 – Linear Search**: O(n)  
- **Search2 – Binary Search**: O(log m)  
- **Search3 – Exponential + Binary Search**: O(log n)  

## How It Works ⚙️
- Generates multiple sorted arrays of random integers.  
- Searches for random values using all three algorithms.  
- Tracks and outputs the average number of comparisons for each algorithm.  

## Example Output 🖥️
200 <= n <= 300  
Search1: 150.23  
Search2: 8.42  
Search3: 6.17  


## Purpose 🚀
This project illustrates how **time complexity** directly impacts algorithm efficiency, bridging theoretical concepts with practical experiments.

## How to Run▶️
